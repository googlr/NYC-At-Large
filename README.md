## Description of the data set
Of the three datasets provided, we choose the [NYPD Complaint Data Historic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) for both the data quality and quantity. Since the source data comes from New York Police Department(NYPD) and ranges from 2006 to 2016, It ensures that the data serves a good source for analysing the public safety in New York City(NYC) and that, as the analyst, we are able to gather enough information to reach a concrete and reliable conclusion.

For a quick overview of the data set, the dataset has 5,580,035 rows and 24 columns, including all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the end of last year (2016). The data is updated annually and the last update is May 1, 2017. A more detailed description could be found on the website of [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
